<p>When I was a child, my dad played songs for me and my sister on the guitar. He was self-taught and didn’t have a large repertoire. Many of the songs he sang were sad, such as “Sea of Heartbreak” and “Tom Dooley.” But there was one song my dad played that affected me much more deeply than the others: “Paradise,” by John Prine. The story of a coal company obliterating a town and its surroundings with the “world’s largest shovel” dug a hole in my stomach every time I heard it. </p>
