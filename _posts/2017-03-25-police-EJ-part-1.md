<p>In the past two years, police killings of African Americans have roused a vigorous movement against police brutality deemed to be rooted in racism. This movement, now synonymous with the slogan Black Lives Matter (BLM), has become one of the most significant in the United States in this century. Commentators have drawn a straight line of descent between BLM and the civil rights and Black power movements that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

<p>This genealogical diagram skips a generation, however. It leaves out the environmental justice (EJ) movement that arose in the 1980s. We shouldn’t leave it out, though, for there is much to learn from it. In particular, the EJ movement illustrates the value of  a social problem as a problem in general as well as highlighting its disproportionate effect on minorities.</p>  

<p>The gist of environmental justice is that environmental problems should not unfairly burden minorities and the poor. This sentiment has precedents, but it was not until the 1980s that an explicit movement emerged. A fight to keep a toxic dump out of mostly black Warren County, North Carolina in 1982 was particularly catalyzing, yielding the largest civil disobedience action in the South since the 1960s.</p>  

<p>In the years since, environmental justice groups have claimed many local victories and they have influenced state and national policy. While much remains to be done, the EJ movement has been successful in rapidly putting its principles on the agenda politics, academics and the media.</p>

<p>Environmental injustice, in fact, has been invoked as part of the discussion of how Black lives are not valued equally. Racially disproportionate exposure to pollution, intentional or not, reveals a racist system just as racial disparities in police killings do. Thus the policy platform from the Movement for Black Lives also includes environmental justice demands.</p>

<p>But beyond incorporating EJ positions, BLM can learn from the movement’s history. In fact, BLM’s anchor issue, police brutality, is analogous to environmental hazards in that it is a “bad” that is borne disproportionately by African Americans. This makes it different from opposition to racism in the provision of “goods” such as housing, schools, voting rights, political power and so on. Ultimately, goods should be distributed evenly (or fairly) while bads should eliminated, not just distributed evenly.</p>

<p>The EJ movement built its powerful message on a wave of concern about environmental hazards that had been swelling for decades. EJ advocates did not discount that these hazards were problems in general. They argued that they were especially bad problems for minorities. </p>

<p>And they were right. Review after review has confirmed that African Americans and other minorities were and are disproportionately burdened by pollution, controlling for other factors. Thus, the EJ argument went, if environmentalists were to be righteous, they ought to direct their energy to righting the environmental problems in the most polluted communities. This argument, along with tenacious grassroots organizing, has made it difficult for environmentalists and governments to pursue environmental objectives without considering the racial justice dimensions of policy. And that’s a good thing.</p>

<p>The problem of racialized police violence may benefit from a similar framing, but we will have to work at it from the other end. BLM has done tremendous work to show how racism has resulted in African Americans experiencing violence at the hands of the police. And BLM activists have sometimes highlighted the police killings of other racial minorities as well. </p>

<p>Police brutality, however, is a hazard to the population in general. It stems from myriad problems, which can yield abuse and killing of whites as well. These include police militarization, poor training, dubious crime reduction theories, lack of accountability, and an ever-failing war on drugs. </p>

<p>But activist commentary has been tepid on police killings of whites – as, indeed, the general public has been. Studies showing that police kill more whites than blacks – in absolute, not relative numbers – has been a point of contention. Arguments using these studies to discount BLM should be rejected. But many whites are killed by the police, sometimes in this should be a point of solidarity.</p>  

<p>Making police brutality more of a general issue, as the environment was for the EJ movement, could yield substantial popular support. Persistent  stress on racial disparities in police brutality could leverage that support for aggressive action in minority communities. And ultimately, as with serious environmental hazards, we can work toward the elimination of police brutality, not its equalization.</p>
