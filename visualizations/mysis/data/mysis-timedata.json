For example, an invasive species introduced to an ecosystem could cause effects that \"cascade throughout the system, like a line of falling dominoes.\" The key example of such an effect was the introduction of mysis shrimp into the Flathead River-Lake ecosystem, which included part of Glacier National Park. The shrimp devoured the native zooplankton. \"This decline, in turn, contributed to a drop in forage fish, ultimately driving away the areas fish predators -- including eagles, otters, coyotes and bears.\""
